ðŸ“˜ Dictionaries in Python

A dictionary is a built-in Python data structure used to store key-value pairs.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
- **Ordered** (Python 3.7+): Maintains the insertion order of items.
- **Mutable**: Allows modification after creation â€” keys and values can be added, changed, or removed.
- **Unindexed**: Elements are accessed using keys, not numeric indices like lists or tuples.
- **Unique Keys**: Each key must be unique within the dictionary; however, values can be duplicated.

ðŸ”¹ Historical Note:
- Prior to Python 3.7, dictionaries were unordered. From Python 3.7 onward, they preserve the insertion order of keys.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
    person = {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "Karachi"
    }
    print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
