Python Data Types
-----------------

Data types define the kind of data a variable can hold, as well as
the operations that can be performed on it. They determine how data
is stored, represented, and manipulated in memory.

Purpose:
--------
- Ensure data is used correctly and efficiently.
- Control behavior such as size, range, and valid operations.
- Prevent errors and maintain code reliability.

Common Built-in Data Types in Python:
-------------------------------------
1. Numeric Types:
   - int    → Integer values (e.g., 5, -3)
   - float  → Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.01)
   - complex → Complex numbers (e.g., 2 + 3j)

2. Text Type:
   - str → Strings (e.g., "hello", 'Python')

3. Boolean Type:
   - bool → True or False

4. Sequence Types:
   - list     → Ordered, mutable (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
   - tuple    → Ordered, immutable (e.g., (1, 2, 3))
   - range    → Sequence of numbers (e.g., range(5))
   - str      → String (e.g., "hello")

5. Set Types:
   - set      → Unordered, unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3})
   - frozenset → Immutable set

6. Mapping Type:
   - dict → Key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 30})

7. None Type:
   - None → Represents the absence of a value

Why It Matters:
---------------
- Helps Python understand how to handle values in memory.
- Enables type-specific methods and behavior.
- Promotes optimized and error-free programming.
