# Data types

#### Object and Mutability

- Everything is object in `s`

#### Object

- Every single object will have a unique `id` and we call this one as `identity`.
- Every object has a unique `type` as well and further each of the object
  will have some of the value.

#### mutable vs immutable

- mutable means changeable
- immutable that is not changeable

And this actually `id` helps us, this `identity` helps us to figure out
whether it's actually `changeable` or it's `not changeable`. Never ever
go through with the `value`. If you go head and have this, confirmation
about whether it's `mutable` or `immutable` with the value, then that is
the wrong way, never do it like this.
