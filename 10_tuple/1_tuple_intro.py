Tuples in Python

A tuple is an ordered and immutable sequence of elements. Tuples are commonly used to store fixed collections of data.

Key Characteristics:
1. Immutable: Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
2. Ordered: Elements maintain the order in which they were defined.
3. Allows Duplicates: Like lists, tuples can contain duplicate values.

Why Use Tuples?
- Immutability: Tuples provide safety and predictability when data must remain constant.
- Hashable: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries due to their immutability.
- Performance: Tuples are generally faster than lists in terms of iteration and memory usage.

When to Use Tuples vs Lists:
- Use tuples when the data should not change (e.g., coordinates, configurations, constants).
- Use lists when the collection needs to be modified (e.g., adding, updating, or removing elements).
