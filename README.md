# Why we need to learn python

- The easiest answer would be because it's easy that is why we want to learn it.

# Portable

The first reason that you want to learn about it is it's really portable
was the program is being written in the `Python` they can actually go a
head and run on variety of operating system including `Windows`, `Mac`
and `Linux` as well. Once it's being written it can be used anywhere at
all, that's the first major advantage of it.

# Readable

Also another example is `Python` is very very readable and it's super easy
to guess what things are doing as long as you can maintain some form of
readability in your code as well, but it's fairly readable. Whatever
you are doing it's very kind of predictable.

# Productive

And the one of the major reason why this language even was invented is
for productive reasons. Writing code in `Java` and `C++` is definitely
could be a little bit faster, you can do the same task but you can also
do the same task in `Python` as well. Almost same, almost all task and
it's meant to be productive, friendly. Python and Java code looks too
verbose. There is a steep learning curve for that. But `Python` you can
pick it up pretty quickly. Within a week you can pick up decent `Python`
And that is one of the reason.

# Standard library

Another reason why everybody love this is something known as `Standard library`
What do you mean by `Standard library`?
A lot of code is already being written in the `Python` and People are very
generous that they have open sourced their code. That means those codes are
available for you even to use commercially and that is the reason, one of
the reason why it's getting popular in the world of data science and machine
learning and AI. Millions of people written the code and made it available
for people hey go a head and use it for free and this huge standard library
availability of the code built-in tools is the reason why everybody loves
and we will learn a lot about pre-built libraries and we just import these
code

# Multi-use

So `Python` a lot of people think is just terminal or just for data science
but no, it can actually use for lot of web apps, we can do a lot of
automation stuff, we can do a lot of data science, data manipulation
csv's even for machine learning AI.
