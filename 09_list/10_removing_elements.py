Removing Elements from Lists in Python
======================================

Python provides multiple ways to remove elements from a list, with `remove()` and `pop()` being two commonly used methods.

- remove():
  Removes the first occurrence of the specified value from the list.
  If the value is not found, a ValueError is raised.
  It does not return the removed value.

- pop():
  Removes and returns the element at the specified index.
  If no index is specified, it removes and returns the last item in the list.
  If the index is out of range, an IndexError is raised.

These methods offer flexibility in list manipulation depending on whether you need to remove by value or by position.
