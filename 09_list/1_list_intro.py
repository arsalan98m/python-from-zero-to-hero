Introduction to Lists in Python
===============================

Python provides powerful sequence types, and one of the most commonly used is the **list**.
Lists help store and manage collections of data efficiently.

1. Lists in Python
-------------------

- Ordered:
  Items in a list maintain the order in which they are inserted and can be accessed using their index.

- Mutable:
  Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation (e.g., add, remove, or modify elements).

- Indexed:
  Each element in a list has a unique index starting from 0, which can be used to retrieve or modify the element.

- Dynamic Size:
  Lists can automatically grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.

- Heterogeneous:
  Lists can hold items of different data types such as integers, strings, floats, booleans, or even other lists.

- Supports Duplicate Values:
  Lists can contain duplicate values; each occurrence is treated as a distinct element in the sequence.
