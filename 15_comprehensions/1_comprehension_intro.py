What are comprehensions?
Now here is the two very important things that you need to know about the comprehensions.

- First of all Almost everything that we are going to do with the comprehension 
  can be done with the loop as well, comprehensions are just a stylized way of
  writing python code. They are the shorter way of writing the code and sometimes
  they feel like writing just English statement and one statement can do the whole
  job.

- The second most important part about the comprehension is that people don't like 
  it in the very first go. There are only handful of people who actually appreciate
  the importance and the syntax of the comprehension in the first go.


Comprehensions are a concise way to create 
list,
sets,
dictionaries,
or generators 
in python using a single line of code.
